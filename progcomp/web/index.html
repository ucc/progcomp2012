</head>

<body>

<h1> Quick Details</h1>
<h2> git </h2>
<p> The git repository is listed on <a href="http://git.ucc.asn.au/"/>The UCC git page</a> as "progcomp2012.git" </p>
<p> <a href="http://git.ucc.asn.au/?p=progcomp2012.git;a=summary"/>Direct Link Here</a></p>

<h2> Mailing List </h2>
<p> We will use the same mailing list as last year (progcomp). </p>

<h2> irc channel </h2>
<p> There is a #progcomp irc channel on the ucc irc server (irc.ucc.asn.au) where you can ask questions or help with setting things up. </p>

<h2> Programming Competition VM </h2>
<p> I am in the process of learning how to set up a VM for this competition. Please be patient. </p>

<h1> Stratego </h1>
<p> <a href="http://www.edcollins.com/stratego/"/>This site</a> explains what Stratego is. </p>

<p> Short Version: It is a board game in which all pieces have a value that is, initially, unknown to the opponent player. The objective is to destroy all enemy pieces, or capture the enemy "Flag". Pieces with higher values destroy pieces with lower values. There are several special pieces/rules. </p>


<h1> Programming Competition </h1>
<p> Create an AI to play Stratego. </p>
<p> Programs are written independently and interface through stdin/stdout with a manager program, which queries them on setup and moves. </p>

<h3> The Manager Program </h3>
<p> The manager program provides the protocol for two seperate AI to play a game of stratego. It has the imaginative name of 'stratego', but I will probably refer to it as 'the manager program' or 'stratego' with absolutely no consistency. </p>
<p> It also aims to assist with AI design by providing options for graphical or terminal output and saving/reading games from files </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Human players are also supported, although the interface is minimal, as this feature is meant for testing. </p>
<p> If you just want to play a game, without having to write your own AI, try <a href="http://www.probe.imersatz.com/"/>Probe</a> </p>

<h3> Protocol </h3>
<p> For the sake of simplicity and keeping things in one place, the protocol is now entirely described in the <a href="http://matches.ucc.asn.au/progcomp2012/progcomp/judge/manager/manual.txt"/>manual page</a> of the manager program. All updates to the protocol will be reflected in that file. </p>


<p> <b> Warning:</b> The accuracy of the above file depends on how recently I pulled it from git. To ensure you get the latest version, find it under "manager/manual.txt" in the <a href="http://git.ucc.asn.au/?p=progcomp2012.git;a=summary"/>git repository</a> </p>

<h2> Long Term Scoring </h2>
<p> <b> WARNING: Work in progress </b> </p>
<p> It is currently planned to store all the AIs on a virtual machine, and periodically run a script to play a round robin </p>
<p> The scores for each round and the total scores will be recorded from the start to the end of the competition. </p>
<p> The competition will run over a period of weeks (depending on general enthusiasm...), and competitors will be able to alter their programs except during the periods in which the script is running. </p>
<p> The following categories will be used when determining the final winners:</p>
<p> <ol>
	<li> Total score</li>
	<li> Number of rounds won</li>
	</ol> </p>

<h2> Sample AI Programs </h2>
<p> <b> WARNING: Work in progress </b> </p>
<p> The following sample programs are currently available (and in a working state - refer to the git repository): </p>
<table border="0">
<tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Language</th> <th> Moves </th> <th> Considers... </th> </tr>
<tr> <td>basic_python</td> <td>Python</td> <td>Randomised</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>basic_cpp</td> <td>C++</td> <td>Randomised</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>asmodeus</td> <td>Python</td> <td>Scored</td> <td>Path finding, known combat results, piece values</td> </th> 
</table> 
<p> It is planned to implement the equivelants of these samples in C++ and Python at least, possibly other languages later. </p>
